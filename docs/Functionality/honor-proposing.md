# Honor Proposal


## Proposing/Validation of Artifacts

As a Semi-Transferable token, HONOR can only be transferred between certain 
contracts. One key privilege of holders is the ability to include new artifacts
to the project node network. This step is key to upholding overall integrity as
a small number of fraudulent or harmful artifacts can cause damage to the 
project as a whole. 

As with blockchains, proposing/validation of new artifacts should require some 
commitment of resources. In this case, seeding with a small threshold of HONOR
from some existing artifact could suffice. More advanced methods, like Token 
Curated Registries, could also be used for more group input. The important piece
is that the protocol has a way to police itself, in exchange for more open, 
decentralized, and permissionless activities.

While the necessity of initial buy-in limits the possible disturbances from 
outside forces, more active techniques could be needed when the call is from 
inside the house. Some potential enhancements will be discussed later.
